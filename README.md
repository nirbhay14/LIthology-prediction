Lithology prediction based on drilling data will be useful for real-time geosteering in the oil and gas industry. Geosteering is a process of controlling directional drilling so that it remains in the pay zone â€” a zone in the subsurface that has an economic value as a hydrocarbon producer. This requires knowledge of lithology surrounding the drill bit. Actually, this information can be provided by running Logging While Drilling (LWD). However, there exists a lag in depth between the measurement by LWD and the current position of the drill bit, and a time delay of LWD to relay to the surface. Therefore, we need an exactly real-time characterization of lithology.
